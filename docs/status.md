# Status

**Current milestone:** R1 — Working core
**Last updated:** 2026-11-11

## Done
- R0 — Foundation (complete)
  - Monorepo skeleton with purpose READMEs, licence, README skeleton, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG, editor/git/env config
  - ADR-001 (stack), ADR-002 (code vs LLM boundary), ADR-003 (approval as hard gate)
  - `apps/api`: uv, FastAPI, `/health` + `/ready`, ruff, mypy, pytest
  - `apps/web`: pnpm, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, eslint, prettier, vitest; home page shows API health
  - Dockerfiles (multi-stage, non-root), Docker Compose (api + web + db) with healthchecks
  - Makefile (`dev`, `down`, `check`, `test`, `eval`), pre-commit with detect-secrets
  - CI (api, web, compose smoke test) green, PR template, README "Run locally"

## Next
- R1: upload and parse XRechnung (UBL/CII) and ZUGFeRD, PDF extraction, KoSIT validation, checks, review queue, CSV export

## Lessons learned
- Docker Compose v5 on Windows builds through Bake: run Compose from the folder that holds the compose file when build contexts are outside it.
- Generate tool baselines that store file paths (detect-secrets) on Linux, so paths use `/` and match in CI and pre-commit.
